Screen Time Analysis lets you know how much time you spend on what kind of applications and websites using your device.
And screen time analysis gives a visual report of the same. 
Done using python.
Screen Time Analysis is the task of analyzing and creating a report on which applications and websites are used by the user for how much time. 
Apple devices have one of the best ways of creating a screen time report.

For the task of screen time analysis, I found an ideal dataset that contains data about:
Date 
Usage of Applications 
Number of Notifications from Applications 
Number of times apps opened
